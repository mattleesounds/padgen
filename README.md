# Welcome to PadGen

Padgen is a generative sample creation tool for music producers. Adjust the attributes to generate a pad(an ethereal ambient musical chord)

Padgen uses Meta's MusicGen model.

The goal of PadGen is to leverage this model and possibly other models in the future in the context of an intuitive and practical interface.
